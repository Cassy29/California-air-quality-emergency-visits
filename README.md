Impacts and patterns in emergency asthma visits based on Californian wildfires

Increased wildfire activity across California in recent decades has become a serious threat for
nearly all dwellings in California. The cause of the increased fire activity has been enabled by various factors,
including natural climate deviation and human-caused climate change. However, the increase
of population and the subsequent growth of cities and dwellings toward the forests, distinctive drought periods, and beetle infestations have enhanced the size and destructiveness of wildfires in the last decade. Four out of California's five largest wildfireshave occurred since 2012. These devastating wildfires also might have contributed to serious health problems, as the air quality dropped significantly in those areas. This, in turn, has an assumed connection of an increase in
respiratory syndromes—even a great distance from the fires. Studies show that recent wildfires burn more than twice the area compared to those in 1970, and the average wildfire season lasts 78 days longer (“Wildfires and Climate Change,” 2018). 
In this research, we provide background, analyze perceptions of fire, and compare them with fire data and socioeconomic
statistics available to-date. The question this study addresses is as follows: are there any socioeconomic and health impacts for the public related to the wildfires, and are there any geographical groups (clusters)? 
Furthermore, we aim to investigate whether there are any dependencies between the considered variables.
