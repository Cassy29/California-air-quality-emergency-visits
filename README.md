Impacts and patterns in emergency asthma visits based on Californian wildfires
 
To contribute to a better understanding on the effects of air quality on public respiratory health.

Increased wildfire activity across California in recent decades has become a serious threat for
nearly all dwellings in California. The cause of the increased fire activity has been enabled by various factors,
including natural climate deviation and human-caused climate change. However, the increase
of population and the subsequent growth of cities and dwellings toward the forests, distinctive drought periods, and beetle infestations have enhanced the size and destructiveness of wildfires in the last decade. Four out of California's five largest wildfireshave occurred since 2012. These devastating wildfires also might have contributed to serious health problems, as the air quality dropped significantly in those areas. This, in turn, has an assumed connection of an increase in
respiratory syndromes—even a great distance from the fires. Studies show that recent wildfires burn more than twice the area compared to those in 1970, and the average wildfire season lasts 78 days longer (“Wildfires and Climate Change,” 2018). 
In this research, we provide background, analyze perceptions of fire, and compare them with fire data and socioeconomic
statistics available to-date. The question this study addresses is as follows: are there any socioeconomic and health impacts for the public related to the wildfires, and are there any geographical groups/clusters? 
Furthermore, we aim to investigate whether there are any dependencies between the considered variables. This investigation will be studied annually by counties to study temporal dynamics.

Data
The report provides an overview of the correlation of data regarding asthma visits, airquality,
and wildfires between 2012 and 2016 and to foster future investigations that will lead to improved health quality and prevent the rise of respiratory syndromes within the wildfire season on the Californian population. The data has been extracted from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (air-quality data) and the California Department of
Public Health (CDPH) (asthma emergency department visit rates), California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection
(CAL FIRE). In addition, the data is, thus, multivariate data aggregated over the counties.

The aim is to compare wildfires in terms of size (over 300 acres of burned area), length of the geographical area (county) with air quality data (healthy and unhealthy days, as well as curtain pollution concentrations), and the number of emergency visits in hospitals to discover and identify patterns and correlations between wildfires, air pollutions, and asthma
visits.
